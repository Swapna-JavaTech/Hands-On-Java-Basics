11.Problem
=========
King’s Island needs a program for its admission booths. When visitors to the park come up to the booth to
purchase their tickets, the worker uses this program to figure out how much to charge them. You will write
this program.
In the first version of the program, there is one ticket price of $30.00. Senior citizens (age ≥ 65) are given a
50% discount. Write this program as follows. Import your Scanner. Declare the needed variables (the person’s
age, the base price of a ticket ($30) and the price you will charge). Input the user’s age, compute the price of
the ticket and output the result in a formatted way (that is, using a $). You do not need to use DecimalFormat
for this part of the program but you will as you enhance it so you might want to set this up now. Save, compile
and run your program a few times, asking the user for different ages such as 10, 50, 65, 80 and 0.

12.Write the java statement that assigns 1 to x if y is greater than 0
13. Suppose that score is a variable of type double. Write the java statement that increases
the score by 5 marks if score is between 80 and 90
14 . Rewrite in Java the following statement without using the NOT (!) operator:
item = !( (i<10) | | (v>=50) )
15. Write a java statement that prints true if x is an odd number and positive
16. Write a java statement that prints true if both x and y are positive numbers
17. Write a java statement that prints true if x and y have the same sign (-/+
18.Write a program that takes as input an employee's salary and a rating of the employee's
performance and computes the raise for the employee.
performance rating here is being entered as a integer—the three possible ratings are "5 - Excellent", " 3 - Good", and " 1-Poor". An employee who is rated excellent will receive a 6% raise, one rated good will receive a 4% raise, and one rated
poor will receive a 1.5% raise.
19.  Write a Java program that reads a floating-point number and prints "zero" if the number is zero. Otherwise, print "positive" or "negative". Add "small" if the absolute value of the number is less than 1, or "large" if it exceeds 1,000,000
20.Write a java program that reads an array and add sum of odd index numbers and multiply the even index numbers 
index 0 is considered as odd.
